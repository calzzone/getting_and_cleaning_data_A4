Since the names of the data are alreay formated to English, this codebook is simply a list of column names. However, they may be relevant if the datatable is read using the base R functions, which trasforms the names of the data. There are 8 columns in total. The first 2 are simply the activity name and the subject ID. The next 66 are the averages of the respective variables in the original dataset, summarized by activity and subject.
